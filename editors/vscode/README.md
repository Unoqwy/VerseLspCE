# Verse Community Edition

Provides a replacement language server for Verse with more features and optimizations.

**WORK IN PROGRESS, STATEMENT NOT QUITE TRUE AT THE MOMENT**

This should be used **in addition to the official Verse extension** by Epic, which provides base language grammar and Workflow Server integration.

TODO : There is no way to disable Epic's language server and keep the rest of their extension so there are duplicate diagnostics, figure out something
